"""The operational read models (step 5, Phase 0): the room reads the ONE packet.

Why this module exists — the Phase-0 truth rule made structural: on main, the Control Room
never consumed ``control.control_status`` at all. Every surface re-derived its own version of
"what is true right now" (routes reading Redis, flags, session files), which is precisely how
three readers produce three answers. This module is the room's ONE gate onto live state: it
builds the packet and derives presentation-ready blocks from it, so:

* every live identifier the room shows (``run_id`` / ``gate_id`` / ``candidate_sha``) comes
  from the packet — the same values the AIO acts on, never a re-derivation;
* availability is carried, not flattened: a block that could not be read stays named in
  ``degraded``, an absent value stays ``null``, and nothing is rendered as a fabricated zero
  or an all-clear;
* rows pass through with their packet fields intact (plus a ``kind`` discriminator), so this
  layer can never invent a field the authority did not return.

``operational_snapshot`` is intentionally read-only and pure given its inputs: it opens no
sockets, reads no clock (``now`` is injected through to ``build_packet``), and never writes.
