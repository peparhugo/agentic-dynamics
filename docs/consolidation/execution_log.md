# Consolidation execution log

Per-stage acceptance-criterion results for the consolidation release (S0–S6). Each entry records
PASS/FAIL against the stage's acceptance criteria (`docs/consolidation/stage_map.md` §4) and the
per-phase deliverables (`experiments/specs/consolidation_stage_*.yaml`).

---

## S0 — architecture spine (phase `spine`)

Spec: `experiments/specs/consolidation_stage_0_architecture_spine.yaml` · phase `spine`.
Deliverable: root `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

| # | Acceptance criterion | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ARCHITECTURE.md` exists at the repo root (exactly one) | PASS |
| 2 | Six sections present: §1 Planes, §2 Package boundaries, §3 Dependency direction, §4 Implemented vs proposed, §5 Canonical execution loop, §6 Supersession map | PASS |
| 3 | §1 lists the eight bounded packages + one-line ownership, mapped to the critique's six systems | PASS |
| 4 | §2 states import may/may-not boundaries and points at `tests/test_dependency_direction.py` (to be added in Stage 1) | PASS |
| 5 | §3 draws the spine `core ← experiment/measurement/runtime/knowledge ← control ← applications` with the two pinned execution→control observation edges (`workflow_runner→step_routing/live`; `opencode/claude_adapter→live`) as observe-only arrows | PASS |
| 6 | §4 names the shipped planes, the reserved-but-empty CAP homes (I0–I7 → `control/*` + `core/contracts.py`), the deferred workstreams (WS-02..08), and names `docs/consolidation/stage_map.md` as the release plan | PASS |
| 7 | §5 states the canonical execution loop (spec → compile → DAG → cells → jobs → attempts → ledger → information → policy → grid → campaign) | PASS |
| 8 | §6 maps supersession: replaces BLUEPRINT×3 + dated handoffs + superseded reviews; leaves mental-model, `src/instrument/CONTEXT.md`, `scripts/CONTEXT.md`, `data_integrity_findings.md`, `docs/review/` authoritative | PASS |
| 9 | The load-bearing rule is stated verbatim as the architectural invariant, not redefined | PASS |

**S0-spine result: 9/9 PASS.**
